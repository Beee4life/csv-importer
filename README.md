# CSV to WP

Welcome to the 'CSV to WP' plugin for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org). I built this initially for the IDF ([International Downhill Federation](http://internationaldownhillfederation.org)), to import rankings to user profiles, but I thought there's more that can be done with it.

## Description 

This plugin will give you the option to import CSV data through file import or raw input and stores it in your database.

I am currently working on stripping all the IDF things i had built in it. You can take a peek in the [development branch](https://github.com/Beee4life/csv-importer/tree/develop) on GitHub, if you're interested.
